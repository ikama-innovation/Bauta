# Bauta
Bauta is a batch automation framework based on [Spring Batch](https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
Features:
- Start/stop/restart jobs via a web-based user interface
- Watch job/step progress and status.
- Steps can generate output that can be displayed in the UI. Typically reports, script logs, stack traces etc.
- Provides "starter" and example projects for different usage scenarios
